This dataset pertains to the direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution in Portugal.  The campaigns primarily involved making phone calls to potential clients. Multiple contacts  were often made with the same client to determine whether they would subscribe to a bank  term deposit or not. The outcome was recorded as either 'yes' or 'no'.

I started by analysing data types of features and verify they hold data same as that of their 
datatype.
I then checked for Nan values in data and removed them.
After that I removed duplicates and checked for outliers usingboxplots and the z-score, drew a countplot for the categorical features and histograms for numeric features, drew a heatmap to show the correlation between independent features, and converted categorical features to numeric.
